# Linked-List
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This is a class I created for a 'Linked List' datatype in C++. Since linked lists are not part 
  of the C++ standard library, I thought I would make one to further my understanding of them and 
  in case I needed one later. This uses a template so you should be able to use it with any struct
  or class object as long as you '#include' your class/struct in the linkedList.h file at the top.</p>
  <h3>Features</h3>
  <p>The following functions and operators have been created for this class:</p>
  <ul><li>size() : Integer</li>
  <li>getElement(int) : Node*</li>
  <li>insert(Node*, int) : void</li>
  <li>erase(int) : void</li>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>...</li></ul>
